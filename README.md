# Boston-Housing-Kaggle-Challenge-with-Linear-Regression_hper

This project involves building a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices in the city of Boston using the Boston Housing dataset. The dataset consists of 506 instances with 13 features. The primary goal is to create a regression model that accurately predicts housing prices.


## Project Description

The project aims to predict housing prices based on features like crime rate, number of rooms, and more. It involves the following steps:

1. Importing the necessary libraries and loading the Boston Housing dataset.
2. Data preprocessing: Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and adding the target variable, 'Price.'
3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
4. Building a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices.
5. Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2).

## Requirements

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

 
## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

cd boston-housing-prediction

 


2. Run the Python script:

python boston_housing.py

 


3. The script will train a Linear Regression model, make predictions, and evaluate the model's performance.

 
## Results

The project evaluates the Linear Regression model's performance and provides metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2). You can find the results in the `results/` directory.

## To improve the model, consider the following steps:

- Feature selection: Choose the most relevant features.
- Cross-validation: Assess model performance more robustly.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters.
-
- from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error
mse = mean_squared_error(ytest, y_pred)
mae = mean_absolute_error(ytest,y_pred)
print("Mean Square Error : ", mse)
print("Mean Absolute Error : ", mae)


Mean Square Error :  33.266961459239106
Mean Absolute Error :  3.838476893830883

 As per the result, our model is only 66.55% accurate. So, the prepared model is not very good for predicting housing prices. One can improve the prediction results using many other possible machine learning algorithms and techniques. 

Here are a few further steps on how you can improve your model.

Feature Selection
Cross-Validation
Hyperparameter Tuning

To improve your linear regression model for predicting housing prices, you can consider several methods, including feature selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning. Here's the code to implement these steps:

# Feature Selection:
    You can select the most relevant features and remove less important ones. This will help reduce overfitting and improve model accuracy.


from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
from sklearn.feature_selection import f_regression

# Select the top k features based on their F-scores
k = 5  # You can choose the desired number of features
selector = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=k)
xtrain_selected = selector.fit_transform(xtrain, ytrain)
xtest_selected = selector.transform(xtest)

# Cross-Validation:
    Implement cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance and ensure it generalizes well.

 

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Create and fit a linear regression model
regressor_cv = LinearRegression()

# Perform cross-validation and compute the R-squared score
cv_scores = cross_val_score(regressor_cv, xtrain_selected, ytrain, cv=5)
mean_cv_score = cv_scores.mean()
print("Cross-Validation R-squared Score: ", mean_cv_score)


Cross-Validation R-squared Score:  0.7153642067564461

# Hyperparameter Tuning:
    Tune the hyperparameters of the linear regression model to find the best combination for improved performance.



from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Create a parameter grid for hyperparameter tuning
param_grid = {'fit_intercept': [True, False], 'normalize': [True, False]}

# Perform a grid search to find the best hyperparameters
regressor_tuned = GridSearchCV(LinearRegression(), param_grid, cv=5)
regressor_tuned.fit(xtrain_selected, ytrain)

# Get the best hyperparameters
best_params = regressor_tuned.best_params_
print("Best Hyperparameters: ", best_params)

Cross-Validation R-squared Score:  0.7153642067564474
Best Hyperparameters:  {'alpha': 10}


 

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
from sklearn.feature_selection import f_regression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Standardize your features
scaler = StandardScaler()
xtrain_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(xtrain)
xtest_scaled = scaler.transform(xtest)

# Feature selection
k = 5  # You can choose the desired number of features
selector = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=k)
xtrain_selected = selector.fit_transform(xtrain_scaled, ytrain)
xtest_selected = selector.transform(xtest_scaled)

# Create and fit a linear regression model
regressor_cv = LinearRegression()

# Perform cross-validation and compute the R-squared score
cv_scores = cross_val_score(regressor_cv, xtrain_selected, ytrain, cv=5)
mean_cv_score = cv_scores.mean()
print("Cross-Validation R-squared Score: ", mean_cv_score)

# Hyperparameter Tuning (if you are using Ridge or Lasso)
param_grid = {'alpha': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]}
regressor_tuned = GridSearchCV(Ridge(), param_grid, cv=5)
regressor_tuned.fit(xtrain_selected, ytrain)
best_params = regressor_tuned.best_params_
print("Best Hyperparameters: ", best_params)
 
Cross-Validation R-squared Score:  0.7153642067564474
Best Hyperparameters:  {'alpha': 10}
 

# If you are getting the same accuracy, it means the model's performance may not improve with the given data. To improve the model's accuracy, you can consider the following steps:

    Feature Engineering: You can explore different feature engineering techniques to create new features from existing ones or transform existing features to better represent the underlying patterns in the data.

    Feature Selection: Experiment with different feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features and eliminate less informative ones.

    Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to evaluate the model's performance more robustly and detect overfitting.

    Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize hyperparameters for the regression model. You can try different regression algorithms, adjust regularization parameters, or explore ensemble techniques.

    Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset, as outliers can significantly affect the model's performance.

    Data Preprocessing: Ensure that your data is preprocessed correctly, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

    Collect More Data: Sometimes, increasing the size of the dataset can lead to better model performance.

    Try Different Models: Experiment with different regression models, such as Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, to see if any of them perform better than Linear Regression for your specific dataset.

    Evaluate Residuals: Analyze the residuals (the differences between predicted and actual values) to identify patterns and potential areas of improvement.

 
  
Here's a brief overview of how you can implement these steps:

Feature Selection:

    You can use techniques like recursive feature elimination (RFE) or feature importance from tree-based models to select the most important features.
    Select a subset of features and retrain your model on the selected features.

Cross-Validation:

    Use k-fold cross-validation to evaluate your model's performance.
    Calculate metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) for each fold and report the average performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

    If you want to explore Ridge or Lasso regression, you can perform hyperparameter tuning by varying the regularization strength (alpha) to find the optimal value.
    You can also experiment with more complex models, such as decision trees or ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
